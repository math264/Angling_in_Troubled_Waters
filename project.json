The second is to emphasize the cartographic ideologies instrumental in our current world of mapping. This ideological assessment will acknowledge the work of Jeremy Crampton, Matthew Edney, Mark Monmonier, and Judith Tyner."

Delineation and demarcation only further complicate things by challenging a nation to maintain it's imperial sovereignty (Monmonmier). Maps are inherently political in their design, but this is as political as it gets. Althought historically used for navigation and reference, maps like the Mercator projection distort reality and are political to a fault (Crampton, Tyner)"

Spain became fairly destitute towards the end of King Philip II's reign, where it declared its fourth bankruptcy in 1596."

Needless to say, they dominated the fishing and agriculture market to become one of the richest countries in the world. Portugal ended up becoming one of the poorest nations in the 19th & 20th centuries once their Asian and South African connections halted. Neglecting domestic infrastructure did not help matters either."

Norway got to keep it's legal system as an independent state, but shared the same monarch and foreign policy. A divergence became more apparent as their economical and political interests clashed. Norway depended on foreign trade, unlike the mercantilist policies favored by Sweden. Norway also tended to be more liberal in their policies, where Sweden favored conservative measures."

        "text": "Mapping and cartography today enable freedom to express passion and purpose, while making connections with those involved. This is possible through interpersonal acceptance of the map and the discourse it creates. Mapping is not reliant on cartographic pogress, but rather it's ability to systemically grow and demonstrate it's progress. This modal mapping approach helped formulate complexity, create new topics, and acquired fresh experiences (Edney)."

        "text": "The complexity of mapping doesn't stop with the acceptance and discourse which follows. It's entanglement with the audience is only exacerbated by the author's intent and generalization of the map's contents. Generalizing a map's story forces it's audience to think subjectively. This ability to twist and shape the narration to evoke certain emotions gives a map its power to persuade (Tyner). Cartographic success stems from pushing social boundaries, mapping new topics from new point-of-views, and collaborating in new territories. It appears that persuasion, evoking of emotions, and perpetuating action is cartography's true intent (Edney, Tyner)."
