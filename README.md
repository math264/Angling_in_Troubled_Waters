# Angling_in_Troubled_Waters
Examining the allegories provided by the LMEC digital collection map. All findings are interpreted and related to cartographic themes addressed within MAP701. See full project prospectus below:

For the conclusion of MAP701's final curation project, I plan to examine a map from the LMEC digital collections titled Angling in Troubled Waters (Links to an external site.) created by Frederick Rose and Matt Hewerdine.

The purpose of this project is to interpret and relate this map's facets to many of the themes addressed throughout MAP701. Specifically, *Angling in Troubled Waters* is easily categorized as persuasive cartography. Defined as a "serio-comic" map by the authors, the caricature playfully delineates Europe's boundary disputes and power struggles. To further equate the map to prior cartographic themes, the examination will also attempt to appreciate the emergence of "mapping without progress". Without getting too muddled, I hope to emphasize the importance interpersonal validation and discourse play within cartography and all it's topics. After all, we wouldn't have subjectivity, discourse, purpose, or passion in mapping through empiricist means. 

The project will be developed using Leaflet's text-based IIIF and will be narrated using the following readings as guides:
